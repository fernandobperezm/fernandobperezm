# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal site. I'm Fernando PÃ©rez, a researcher and computer engineer with experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. 

## Experience

In the past five years, I've been a **ML and Recommender Systems Researcher** at Politecnico di Milano, where I mainly studied Recommender Systems (check out [the lab's page](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it)), their application on industrial environments, online evaluation, experimentation of UI personalization, and more. My works have focused on constructing and experimenting with "Impression-Aware Recommender Systems", a novel family of recommenders that leverage impressions (past recommendations) and interactions (users' actions) to produce relevant recommendations. 

Two years before becoming a researcher, I was a **Software Engineer** at Mahisoft, an IT consulting company. As a Software Engineer, I worked on multiple agile teams in the entire development stack, capturing requirements and transforming them into production-grade large-scale systems. As a team, we used the latest yet well-tested technologies. We developed frontends using React.js and typescript and backends using .NET alongside SQL Server, or Spring Boot alongside MySQL.
