# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile 🥳 This is the place where you'll find all my open source works and contributions to the community 👨🏽‍💻.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

I'm a Ph.D student at Politecnico di Milano where I work on Recommender Systems (check out [my lab's page](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it) 🖥), their application on industrial environments, online evaluation, experimentation of UI personalization, and more.

I'm also interested on producing high quality research 🚀. I worked for almost two years in industry as Software Engineer and I try to apply the things I learned on my research activities.

## ⚡ Fun facts
- I played drums for almost 8 years 🥁 I did not become proficient at it, but it was something that I really enjoyed.
- I play videogames occasionally with my friends, normally I'm the bait so we can take down other teams 🤣.
