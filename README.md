# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal site.

## Who am I?

I'm a Ph.D candidate at Politecnico di Milano where I study Recommender Systems (check out [the lab's page](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it)), their application on industrial environments, online evaluation, experimentation of UI personalization, and more. 
Ultimately, I've been researching impression-aware recommender systems, where I'm focus on their characterization, evaluation, and replication.
I'm interested on producing high quality research. Generally, I apply to my research activities what I learnt from working two years as a Software Engineer in the industry.
