# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile 🥳 This is the place where you'll find all my open source works and contributions to the community 👨🏽‍💻.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

I'm a Ph.D student at Politecnico di Milano where I work on Recommender Systems (check out [my lab's page](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it) 🖥), their application on industrial environments, online evaluation, experimentation of UI personalization, and more.

I'm also interested on producing high quality research and products 🚀. I worked for almost two years in industry as Software Engineer and I try to apply the things I learned on my daily work.

## 🤓 Important repositories
Currently most of the code here on GitHub is related to University project, but soon I'll start publishing my research code and personal projects.

In the meantime, you can have a look on the following repos:
- My undergrad thesis: [🔗](https://github.com/fernandobperezm/recsys-cotraining).

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
Open source projects and applied Machine Learning.

## 📫 How to reach me

For academic/research inquiries just send an email to [my PoliMi email](mailto:fernandobenjamin.perez@polimi.it). For any other contribution or just to talk send an email [to my personal account](mailto:fperezmaurera@gmail.com).

## ⚡ Fun facts
- I played drums for almost 8 years 🥁 I did not become proficient at it, but it was something that I really enjoyed.
- I play videogames occasionally with my friends, normally I'm the bait so we can take down other teams 🤣.
