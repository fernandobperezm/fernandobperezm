# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal site. I'm Fernando PÃ©rez, a researcher and computer engineer with experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. 

## Who am I?

I obtained my Ph.D. in Information Technology at Politecnico di Milano, where I studied Recommender Systems (check out [the lab's page](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it)), their application on industrial environments, online evaluation, experimentation of UI personalization, and more. 
Ultimately, I've been investigating Impression-Aware Recommender Systems, a novel family of recommenders that leverage impressions (past recommendations) and interactions (users' actions) to produce relevant recommendations. 
During my doctoral time, I focused on the characterization, evaluation, and experimentation of this family of recommenders.
I'm interested in producing high-quality research and applying what I learned as a Software Engineer in the industry.
