# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal site. I'm Fernando B. PÃ©rez Maurera, a scientist and engineer experienced in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering products. 

## Work Experience

In the past five years, I've been a **Machine Learning and Recommender Systems Scientist** at Politecnico di Milano, where I mainly studied Recommender Systems and their development and application in industrial environments. My works focused on designing and experimenting with "Impression-Aware Recommender Systems", a new family of recommendation models that leverage impressions (past recommendations) and interactions (users' actions) to produce higher-quality recommendations. 

Prior to becoming a scientist, I was a **Software Engineer** at Mahisoft, an IT consulting company. As a Software Engineer, I worked on multiple agile teams in the entire development stack, capturing requirements and transforming them into production-grade large-scale systems. As a team, we used the industry-standard yet well-tested technologies. We developed frontends using React.js and typescript and backends using .NET alongside SQL Server, or Spring Boot alongside MySQL.
